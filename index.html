								<b>A Comparison of Star-Formation Histories Derived from UniverseMachine
and LEGA-C at 0.6 < z < 1 </b><br> I tested UniverseMachine galaxy star formation histories with those observed in the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) Spectroscopic Survey.
	I quantified the formation time scales of simulated galaxies compared with observed ones. Here we found that the observational correlations between formation time and stellar mass are weaker than predicted by the UniverseMachine and this discrepancy is especially pronounced for the quiescent sample. 
	This suggests that the UniverseMachine model falls short in accounting for all the star formation processes captured by SPS modeling. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024RNAAS...8...16S/abstract/">(Steel et al. 2024)</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Rejuvenation in the UniverseMachine</b><br> I studied rare galaxies that deviate from traditional evolutionary paths and show a sudden episode of star-formation after a long period of quiescence. I investigated these rejuvenating galaxies in UniverseMachine simulations and compare them with observational evidence. The goal is to quantify their number density and understand the physical processes that could be driving this phenomenon. (Kaushal+2024 in prep)
